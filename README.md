# dotnetcore2-microservices-docker-proxy
A quick POC on having multiple .Net 6 WebAPI running in docker containers accessible through an nginx proxy container.

#Prerequisite
Your need to have Visual Studio 2022 installed with Docker support which imply you also have Docker installed on your machine WSL2.

# How to run
Open the solution into VS2022, hit "Docker" start button on top. Everything should fireup. You can then access the services by going to http://localhost:8080
